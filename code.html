      <p>The first thing I did to make this website , is to learn how to add an image with color as a logo . Then I learned how to move a few pictures<br><br>together when scrolling down in a website using CSS and Image . After this , I made an index page which is the home page of the website . I<br><br>made a ps note because this site is made on a desktop and I don't know how to make it fit for both desktop and mobile websites . Then I made a<br><br>few more changes to my website like adding more sections to it and adding a picture describing what icons represent on the index page . Then I<br><br>worked on about section, which took quite a lot of time and had learn how to add gradient . After this I had to take a 2 days rest because I was<br><br>too tired after taking rest I began to code the explore section , which took me 3 days to complete . Then I did the code section, which is this .<br><br>Then I did work section . Lastly I did contact section , this is how I made this website .</p>
